<h3>Instructions Assignment 2</h3>
<p>The Municipality is worried that the canal- and support boats might pollute the air with their
    diesel engines. Since the Municipality wants to create ideal conditions for the swimmers so
    they can set records (always nice for PR), it is your task to figure out if their concern is
    warranted and what should or could be done to improve conditions. Next to that, Amsterdam
    wants to advertise this event as a Neutral Energy Event©™® (NEE).</p>

<h4>Question 1: How many of the canal boats currently in use are diesel/fossil fuel driven and how many boats are electrical driven?</h4>
<h4>Question 2: Are there peak times for the canal boats? </h4>
<h4>Question 3: Try to compare the energy use of the canal boats to some other activities in the city. Use canal boats more or less energy in relation to their carbon footprint compared to these other activities? </h4>
<h4>Question 4: Would you consider it economically feasible?</h4>
<h4>Question 5: How many support boats and vehicles are needed for the Paralympics event only?</h4>
<p>When looked at the support vessels for previous Olympic open water swimming, for example the men's 10km marathon swimming of the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, it can be seen that the number of support vessels is 14 for 26 competitors, these vessels are a mix of motorboats and jetskis (Highlights Olympic men's 10km open water swimming, Eurosport). The larger motorboats are the support vessels for the judges and organizers of the event, while the jetskis are support vessels for the lifeguards. Next to that, there are also multiple lifeguards on kayaks and paddleboards rowing along the swimmers as well. In contrast to other marathon swimming events, the Olympic race is a lap course instead of a point-to-point course. This also has an influence on the number of support vessels involved with the race, as the coaches of the swimmers are stationed on a pontoon along the course. In other circumstances, coaches and/or trainers of the swimmers kayak or paddle along with their swimmer as per the regulations of the relevant governing and regulatory bodies (FINA, WOWSA and/or BLDSA for example).</p>

<p>As the route of the proposed test event is a point-to-point with a section where the swimmers pass twice, we propose to have a combination of both situations previously explained with regard to coaches and trainers. We propose to place a pontoon in the middle of the Oosterdok area behind the Nemo pier, between it and the edge of Hanneke's Boom terrace. From this pontoon coaches or trainers can hand the swimmers drinks or nutrition and give instructions. While at the same time we propose to have a trainer or coach row along their swimmer in a kayak as well to provide extra security for the swimmers. In terms of other support vessels, we expect a similar number of participants for the proposed test events as the previously mentioned Olympic event. Therefore we think a similar amount of support vessels would be sufficient in addition to the extra kayaks and paddleboards for the trainers/coaches.</p>
<h4>Question 6: If only clean energy can be used, how many solar panels or wind turbines are needed? </h4>
<h4>Question 7: Is it possible to accommodate these facilities within the city?</h4>
<h4>Question 8: Would their be any effect on the water quality if there are less/no canal boats using fossil fuels?</h4>
