<h2>Instructions Assignment 4</h2>
<p>For this exercise you have chosen a route in Amsterdam for the canal swimming event.
    Preferably you have this route calculated using Python. You can set a start point and an end
    point and then try to find a route that has a certain distance (min. 5 km.)</p>

<p> The Municipality wants you to find a location for the Event Headquarters. They decided it
    would be best if this E.H. is as close to the centre of the swimming route. There is a bit of a
    concern for the after party and the stream of visitors. They want you to quantify the number of
    visitors that can reach the event and the capacity for festivities after the event.</p>

<h4>Question 1: Find the centre of the nodes of the swimming route.</h4>
<p>The following code calculates the centre of the nodes:</p>

<pre>
  <code class="language-python">
#importing packages
from gpx_converter import Converter
import osmnx as ox
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline

#loading in the route into a csv file
Converter(input_file='Paralympictestevent.gpx').gpx_to_csv(output_file='covertedgxp.csv')
df = pd.read_csv('covertedgxp.csv')
    
# Calculating the centre of the nodes of the swimming route (coördinates)
X = df.latitude
Y = df.longitude
centre_point = X.mean(),Y.mean()
    
# Plotting the centre of the nodes of the swimming route
city = ox.graph_from_point(centre_point, dist=2000)
    
lat,lon =  centre_point
fig, ax = ox.plot_graph(city, show=False, close=False,node_alpha=.2,edge_alpha=.3, 
bgcolor='w',node_color='b', node_size=1)
plt.plot(lon,lat,c='r',marker='o',markersize = 10, label = 'centre node')
   
plt.legend(loc='best')
plt.show()</code></pre>

<p>After running this code you will recieve this plot:</p>

  </figure>
</div>

<h4>Question 2: Use the centre to find a suitable spot for the Event Headquarters.</h4>
<p>As the centre of our swimming route is located within the IJ-tunnel, a headquarters for the event would not be feasible in this location. The quays around the IJ-tunnel are equally not suitable for a headquarters, as they are too narrow to facilitate multiple temporary buildings. The closest larger open spaces are located on the Marineterrein. There are two options, a land-based headquarters or a headquarters on top of a floating pontoon in the Binnenhaven of the Marineterrein. The land-based headquarters would utilize the Voorwerf park and the adjacent parking lot of the Marineterrein and would have the benefit of reaching connecting roads to the start and finish quicker. However, the floating headquarters benefits from having a larger area that it could utilize to put up temporary buildings.</p>

<h4>Question 3 and 4: Find the closest bus and tram stops at the start and finish of the swimming route. How many people can be transported within an hour? Can you find which bus and tram lines these are? And can you find their routes?</h4>
<pre>
  <code class="language-python">
#storing coördinates start en finish point
start_point = df.latitude[0],df.longitude[0]
finish_point = df.latitude[62],df.longitude[62]

#Finding closest busstop for start and finish
busstop_start = ox.features.features_from_point(start_point, tags =  {'highway': 'bus_stop'}, dist = 130)
busstop_finish = ox.features.features_from_point(finish_point, tags =  {'highway': 'bus_stop'}, dist = 150)

print(busstop_start)
print(busstop_finish)

#plotting closest busstop for start and finish
city = ox.graph_from_point(centre_point, dist=2000)

start_lat,start_lon =  (52.36379,4.89826)
finish_lat,finish_lon =  (52.37225,4.91797)

fig, ax = ox.plot_graph(city, show=False, close=False,node_alpha=.2,edge_alpha=.3, 
bgcolor='w',node_color='b', node_size=1)
plt.plot(start_lon,start_lat,c='r',marker='o',markersize = 10, label = 'Busstop Keizersgracht ')
plt.plot(finish_lon,finish_lat,c='b',marker='o',markersize = 10,label = 'Busstop Kattenburgerstraat ')

plt.legend(loc='best')
plt.show()</code></pre>

<p>Running this code leads to the following plot:</p>
<div class = "items">
  <figure>
  <img src=".\PNGs\as4q3.png" alt="tramline 4" width="400" height="400">
    <figcaption> Figure 2: Bus stops at the start and finish of the swimming route </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>The closest tram stop to the start of the route is the Keizersgracht stop of tramline 4 at only a minute walk away. Tramline 4 has an irregular schedule, but generally a tram to the central station leaves on average every 15 minutes. The trams have a capacity of between 131 and 151 places with a single carriage (over.gvb.nl/tram-in-cijfers). With a frequency of 4 per hour, the tramline can transport between 524 and 604 passengers per hour in both directions. The closest bus stop is the same stop as the closest tram stop, however the bus stop only serves nightbuses and does not have any services during the day. This is also the case for other bus stops around the area of the start.</p>
<div class = "items">

    <figcaption> Figure 3: Image of the route of tramline 4</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>
<p>For the finish, the closest tram stop is the 1e Coehoornstraat stop of tramline 7 (purple in the picture) between Azartplein and Sloterpark. This tram station is an 11-minute walk away from the finish area. This line does have a regular schedule, and trams leave in both directions every 10 minutes. As stated before, the capacity of trams used by the GVB is between 131 and 151 passengers per single carriage. So for tramline 7, this means a caring capacity of between 655 and 755 passengers per hour. The closest bus stops to the finish area is the Kattenburgerstraat which service the 22 busline (orange), however, the Kattenburgerplein 43 busline (pink) is only marginally further away. The 22 line connects to the Sloterdijk train station and the Muiderpoort train station with a frequency of every 10 minutes. The 43 line connects to the Borneo Eiland and the central train station, with a frequency of every 15 minutes. The capacity of the busses used by the GVB is 85 for standard busses and 150 for articulated busses (over.gvb.nl/bus-in-cijfers). For line 22, with a frequency of 5 times per hour, this means a caring capacity of between 425 and 750 per hour. As the frequency of line 43 is lower at 4 per hour, the caring capacity is lower at 340 to 600 passengers per hour.</p>

</div>

<h4>Question 5: Calculate the centrality of the start, finish, and centre node of the route. Which centrality calculation makes the most sense.</h4>
<pre>
  <code class="language-python">
    #storing coördinates start, centre and finish point
    location_centre = centre_point
    location_start = df.latitude[0], df.longitude[0]
    location_finish = df.latitude[62], df.longitude[62]
    
    #Finding nearest node for start, centre and finish point
    nodes_centre = ox.distance.nearest_nodes(city, location_centre[1], location_centre[0])
    nodes_start = ox.distance.nearest_nodes(city, location_start[1], location_start[0])
    nodes_finish = ox.distance.nearest_nodes(city, location_finish[1], location_finish[0])
    
    #Function for calculating the closeness centrality
    def closeness_centrality (u):
        closeness = nx.closeness_centrality(city, u = u,  wf_improved=True)
        return closeness
    
    #Printing the closeness centrality for the centre, start and finish node
    print('the closeness centrality of the centre node is', closeness_centrality(nodes_centre))
    print('the closeness centrality of the start node is', closeness_centrality(nodes_start))
    print('the closeness centrality of the finish node is', closeness_centrality(nodes_finish))</code></pre>

<p>When running this code, you will recieve the answers:
  <pre>
    <code class = "language-python">
the closeness centrality of the centre node is 0.02730357697455819
the closeness centrality of the start node is 0.025498038590615207
the closeness centrality of the finish node is 0.024650822273494452
    </code>
  </pre>
</p>
<h4>Question 6: Find all cafes, restaurants near the finish line. Walking time smaller than 10 minutes.</h4>
