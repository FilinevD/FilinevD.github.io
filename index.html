    <h2>Welcome to Our Website</h2>
    <p>This is the home page of our website for Data 1. We are Thijmen, RafaÃ«l and Filine and together we worked on the project for Data 1. Here on the main page you can find the instructions of the project. Hope you enjoy!</p>
    <h3>Info about the Project</h3>
    <p>Paris is hosting the Paralympics in 2024. One of the events at the Paralympics is an open water swimming event in the Seine (apparently the water is clean or so the French say). Since the City of Amsterdam thinks it is better than Paris, they want to host an event before the Paralympics, snubbing the Parisians. The idea is to host a 5km. open water swimming event through the canals of Amsterdam. You are asked by the municipality of Amsterdam to advise on the feasibility of the event from the perspective of the safety of the partaking athletes from an environmental perspective. The event is going to be hosted in May.</p>
